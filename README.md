# Railway-Ticket-Management-System
The Railway Ticket Management System facilitates the passengers to enquire about the tickets available, booking, managing, and cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc. Built by using Python, SQL, SQL connector Python Module, and MySQL Database.
So, this project basically has 2 phases, 1st is the user input phase where all the info about where train in mentioned and we can start booking our ticket by filling the necessary information, and in the backend a database is created in which there are 4 datasets or table
which basically used to store all the information. 
1. Train list – all the data about train like train no., train name, fare (different for gen, ac) boarding and destination stations.
2. Available days – which train running on which date, day.
3. Train status – gives status about the available, booked, and total seats by category (AC/gen) present in each train. Like ac/gen booked
	 tickets, ac/gen available tickets. 
4. Passenger detail – contains all the details about each passenger which was given by passenger during book of ticket. Like passenger name,
	 age, sex, details of train he booked, confirm status.
